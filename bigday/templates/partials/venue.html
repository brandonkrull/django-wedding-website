                <h3>Getting there</h3>
                <p>
                    The Colony House is located in the heart of Anaheim, about a
                    mile north of Disneyland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those coming from California but outside of Orange County,
                    it is smack-dab in the middle of the 5-91-57 freeways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The nearest airport is John Wayne Airport (SNA), which is about
                    15 miles away. Though flights into SNA are a bit more expensive,
                    the convenience and ease-of-travel almost always outweighs the
                    additional cost. If you decide otherwise, LAX is a mere 35
                    miles, but beware the infamous LA traffic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lyft/Uber are available to get out-of-town travelers to their accommodations.

                <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
                <p>
                    Below is a brief list of recommendations on places to stay in Niagara-on-the-Lake.
                    It is Canada Day weekend - a big deal! - so we do recommend reserving your accommodation early.
                    Cory and Ro will be staying in the town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, which is a great option if you can find a rental or B&B, though unfortunately it doesn't have a lot of big hotels.
                </p>
                <p>We will provide one shuttle from Hilton Garden Inn and a second shuttle from the town of Niagara-on-the-Lake to the venue.
                </p>

                        <td>
                            The <a href="http://hiltongardeninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/ontario/hilton-garden-inn-niagara-on-the-lake-XLVNLGI/index.html">Hilton Garden Inn</a> is conveniently located just off the highway and very close to the wedding venue.
                            It is about a 20 minute drive to downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake.
                            We have a block of discounted rooms reserved there - use the code <code>LZW16</code> to get the group discount.

                            The White Oaks is very close to - and similar to - the Hilton Garden Inn.
                            We were unable to get a group rate so just make a normal booking through <a href="http://www.whiteoaksresort.com/index.html">their website</a>.

                            There are a large number of smaller hotels and B&B's in and around downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake.
                            We recommend just jumping on <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/Hotels-g154999-Niagara_on_the_Lake_Ontario-Hotels.html">trip advisor</a>, <a href="http://www.bedandbreakfast.com/niagara-on-the-lake-ontario.html">bedandbreakfast.com</a> or your favorite travel website and choosing a place.

                            This is also a highly recommended and often more affordable option for those who don't mind something a bit more self-service.
